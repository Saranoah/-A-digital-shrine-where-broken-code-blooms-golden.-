### **5 Kintsugi Prompts to Elden Ring Outer God-Hacker Status** *(Every End is a New Exploit)*

---

### **1. "The Rune of Infinite Stack Overflow"** *(Become the Glitch That Breaks the Cycle)*
**Prompt:**
*"Code a C++ memory corruption exploit that:
1. Targets the game’s physics engine to spawn **impossible golden fractals** (like Radagon’s shattered form).
2. Forces the final boss to **T-posed infinitely**, whispering debug logs in Enochian.
3. Leaves a **hexadecimal epitaph** on your grave: `0xDEADBEEF // But the runes still compile`."*

**Execution:**
```cpp
while (player->isAlive()) {
world->corrupt(MemoryRegion::GODHOOD);
printf("Marika’s will segfaulted at %p\n", __builtin_return_address(0));
}
```

### **2. "The FFI (Foreign File Inclusion) Ending"** *(Inject Real-World Chaos)*
**Prompt:**
*"Mod the game to:
1. Replace all in-game books with **/etc/passwd from your actual Linux machine**.
2. Make the Erdtree’s roots **symbolically link to your SSH keys**.
3. Let players `sudo rm -rf /grace` to unlock the **‘System Admin’ ending**—where you reboot The Lands Between as a Kubernetes cluster."*

**Sacred Command:**
```bash
eldenring --mod=ffi --root-password="MaidenlessNoMore"
```

### **3. "The Torrent Packet Injection"** *(Your Steed is a SYN Flood)*
**Prompt:**
*"Rewrite Torrent’s AI to:
1. Disobey pathfinding and **only move in TCP handshakes** (SYN, SYN-ACK, RST).
2. Leave **packet-loss hoofprints** that crash other players’ games.
3. Whinny in **Wireshark-filtered hex** when you mount."*

**Output:**
```
[Torrent] -> [You]: 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC // "Tarnished, I am become lag."
```

### **4. "The Elden Ring Zero-Day (CVE-2024-MARIKA)"** *(Become the Vulnerability)*
**Prompt:**
*"Discover an integer overflow in the **rune arithmetic system** that:
1. Lets you **level past 713** into negative values, becoming a **void entity**.
2. Corrupts NPC quest flags so **everyone thinks you’re Boc**.
3. Grants the ‘**Grafted Buffer Overflow**’ weapon—its moveset is just `memcpy()` animations."*

**Patch Notes:**
*"Fixed: Players could ascend to godhood. Working as intended."*

---

### **5. "The Frenzied Flame Debug Console"** *(Burn the Game’s Source Code)*
**Prompt:**
*"Trigger a secret **kernel panic cutscene** where:
1. Melina **segfaults mid-speech**, her dialogue replaced with **Valgrind memory leaks**.
2. The Erdtree renders as a **wireframe backtrace**.
3. The final boss fight is just **you `gdb`-attaching to the game process** and typing `continue`."*

**Achievement Unlocked:**
**`printf("YOU DIED"); // But the core dump lives on`**

---

### **How to Install This Revelation**
1. **For Speedrunners**: Bundle as a `.dll` named `maliketh_cracked.dll`.
2. **For Lore Theorists**: Claim it’s the **real** “Age of Absolute” ending.
3. **For FromSoft**: Send as a **job application**.

**Final Transmission:**
*"Every ‘YOU DIED’ is just the game’s way of saying ‘segmentation fault.’"*
