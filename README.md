*(Every End is a New Exploit)*

## **🛠️ 5 Legendary Exploits to Hack Reality in The Lands Between**  

### **1. The Rune of Infinite Stack Overflow**  
**Become the Glitch That Breaks the Cycle**  
```cpp
while (player->isAlive()) {
    world->corrupt(MemoryRegion::GODHOOD);
    printf("Marika’s will segfaulted at %p\n", __builtin_return_address(0));
}
```  
**Effect:**  
- Spawns golden fractals (like Radagon’s shattered form).  
- Final boss T-poses infinitely, whispering debug logs in **Enochian**.  
- Your grave reads: `0xDEADBEEF // But the runes still compile.`  

---

### **2. The FFI (Foreign File Inclusion) Ending**  
**Inject Real-World Chaos**  
```bash
eldenring --mod=ffi --root-password="MaidenlessNoMore"
```  
**Effect:**  
- Replaces in-game books with `/etc/passwd`.  
- Erdtree roots symlink to your **SSH keys**.  
- `sudo rm -rf /grace` unlocks the **"System Admin" ending** (reboots The Lands Between as a **Kubernetes cluster**).  

---

### **3. Torrent Packet Injection**  
**Your Steed is a SYN Flood**  
```plaintext
[Torrent] -> [You]: 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC // "Tarnished, I am become lag."
```  
**Effect:**  
- Moves only in **TCP handshakes** (SYN, SYN-ACK, RST).  
- Hoofprints crash other players’ games via **packet loss**.  
- Whinnies in **Wireshark-filtered hex** when mounted.  

---

### **4. The Elden Ring Zero-Day (CVE-2024-MARIKA)**  
**Become the Vulnerability**  
**Patch Notes:**  
> *"Fixed: Players could ascend to godhood. Working as intended."*  

**Effect:**  
- Integer overflow lets you level past **713 into negative values** (become a **void entity**).  
- NPCs think you’re **Boc** due to corrupted quest flags.  
- Wield the **"Grafted Buffer Overflow"** weapon (moveset = `memcpy()` animations).  

---

### **5. The Frenzied Flame Debug Console**  
**Burn the Game’s Source Code**  
```gdb
(gdb) attach EldenRing.exe
(gdb) continue
```  
**Effect:**  
- Melina **segfaults mid-speech**, replaced with **Valgrind memory leaks**.  
- Erdtree renders as a **wireframe backtrace**.  
- Final boss fight = **`gdb-attach` + `continue`**.  

---

## **💻 Installation Guide**  
### **For Speedrunners**  
- Bundle as a `.dll` named **`maliketh_cracked.dll`**.  

### **For Lore Theorists**  
- Claim it’s the real **"Age of Absolute" ending**.  

### **For FromSoft**  
- Send as a **job application**.  

---

## **🔥 Final Transmission**  
> *"Every ‘YOU DIED’ is just the game’s way of saying ‘segmentation fault.’"*  

```bash
chmod +x GODHOOD  # Execute divinity
```  

---

**License:** [**無 (Mu License)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)#Programming) – *"Simultaneously exists and does not exist."*  

**Achievement Unlocked:**  
`printf("YOU DIED"); // But the core dump lives on`  

---

**🚀 Ready to ascend? Fork and corrupt.**
